<span style="font-size:8vw"> AI </span> | Apple of the 21st century. Hi everyone, I am Brilian Tafjira Nugraha (abbr. BTN), Here to make a place to share ideas and things I did in the past years. Some of them might be old, since I rarely post things before, but I realize what kind of impact it has on myself as a self-reminder, and (might be) other people.

For introduction, I am a Project Manager/Senior Computer Vision Engineer with 6+ years working as aprofessional in the Deep learning area: object detection, classification, segmentation, anomaly detection, inference optimization, unknown picking and detection, and LLM integration.

My recent Research include:

1. 6D Pose Estimation and Tracking at 50-100fps/object on PC; 20-30 FPS on Jetson AGX Orin.
2. Optical Character Recognition with 20 FPS on PC / 5-10 FPS on client-server scenario.
3. Anomaly Detection at up to 100 FPS on PC.
4. Foundational Object Detection / Faster Segment Anything (2 FPS vs 0 FPS original; 20 FPS with progressive predictions).
